# Acnovation

## Introduction

This is a database application made for the course TTTU2983 Advanced Database. The application is about an online store that sells light aircraft, gliders and aviation equiopments.

## Forms

The two main forms are
- frm_mainscreen_a187806
- frm_tableView_a187806

where the latter is a general form where its instance is made to display data from different tables using different SQL statements. [More details here](./frm_mainmenu_a187806.vb).

## Database and Images

These two components are being placed in `data/` and `images/` respectively but I have also added duplicate in `bin/debug` for inspection.
