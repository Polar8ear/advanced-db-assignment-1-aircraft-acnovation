# Acnovation

## Introduction
This is a database application made for the course TTTU2983 Advanced Database. The application is about an online store that sells light aircraft, gliders and aviation equiopments.

## Folder structure

### getImageScript/

For script to get images of the database records. As the aircraft products are hard to be found on amazon so I used Google Image API to search for the images of aircrafts and gliders. Another script that I have forked and modified is [Amazon Scraper](https://github.com/Polar8ear/amazon-scraper) where it can get all the images which is unfortunately not used for this assignment.

### prj_acnovation_a187806/

A VB.NET WinForm Application that connects to the database and show all the tables. This is the only function for now.
